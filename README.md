Hi everyone, <br />

I recently started my PhD at Polytechnique in biomedical engineering. My research focuses on analyzing structural pediatric brain MRI data to understand neurodevelopment. Previously, I studied the potential use of deep learning based techniques for deformable image registration using T1-weighted images from the Calgary Preschool Dataset. I am interested in anything health related and how we can improve these systems world-wide!

During this BrainHack school, my project will consist of exploring the Predictive Clinical Neuroscience (PCN) toolkit as well as other tools useful for reproducible neuroimaging data analyses such as high performance computing (HPC), GitHub and FreeSurfer. An initial project description can be found [here](https://github.com/brainhack-school2022/dimitrijevic_project/blob/main/project_description.md). This was however modified during the project.
